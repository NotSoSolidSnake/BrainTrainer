The goal of the program is to be able to practice mental mathematics, memorize phone numbers, practice the Dominic System, and whatever else I decide to add.

Current Features:

Can generate addition problems in the range of 0-10, 0-100, and 0-1000.
It will loop until the answer given is the correct one.
A Recursive method has been implemented to make the above possible.
You can return to the "menu" of the addition method to do a different type of problem with out closing the problem.

Subtraction has been added. It functions just like addition.

Multiplication has been added. It functions differently than the above two. 
You can practice basic multiplication tables, mutiplication 2-by-1, multiplication 3-by-1, and a special 'arthur' mode
the arthur mode is from the book Secrets of Mental Math (The entire math section of the program was witten specifically for this book)
You only need to have mastered the multiplication tables 0-10 in the book.

TODO Later:
add division 
everthing else

I will add more to this list later.
