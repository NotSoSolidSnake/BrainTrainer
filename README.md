This is a readme file

This readme file is for my brain trainer program. 

The goal of the program is to be able to practice mental mathematics, memorize phone numbers, practice the Dominic System, and whatever else I decide to add.

Current Features:

Can generate addition problems in the range of 0-10, 0-100, and 0-1000.
It will loop until the answer given is the correct one.
A Recursive method has been implemented to make the above possible.
You can return to the "menu" of the addition method to do a different type of problem with out closing the problem.

TODO Later:
Make an interface to base the math classes off of
Let the user return back to the main method and choose a different drill
add subtraction 
add multiplication 
add division 

I will add more to this list later.
