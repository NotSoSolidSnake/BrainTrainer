This is a Brain Trainer application that I am coding in order to practice my programming abilities and also to be able to use it for my own brain training.

The goal of the program is to be able to practice mental mathematics, memorize phone numbers, practice the Dominic System, and whatever else I decide to add.

Current Features:

Can generate addition/subtraction problems in the range of 1-10, 1-100, and 1-1000.
It will loop until the answer given is correct.
A Recursive method has been implemented to make the above possible.
You can return to the "menu" of the addition method to do a different type of problem with out closing the problem.

Multiplication has been added. It functions differently than the above. 
You can practice basic multiplication tables, mutiplication 2-by-1, multiplication 3-by-1, and a special 'arthur' mode.
The arthur mode is from the book Secrets of Mental Math (The entire math section of the program was witten specifically for this book)

The ability to generate phone numbers has been added. You can generate a random number, a number with a specific area code, and one with both the area code and first three digits given.

TODO Later:
add division 
anything else I can think of
